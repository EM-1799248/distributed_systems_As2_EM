# Instructions to run
*Notes:*
- Requires Gson to be installed
- Testing command requires hamcrest-core-1.3.jar and junit-4.12.jar (in .idea/libraries)
- If using a custom port, make sure you use the same port number when starting all entities.
- To run the test files, please clean the files before and after running the make command.

1. To compile all files, type the following command in a terminal.
   ``` Bash
   make all
   ```

   ``` Bash
   make run-server
   ```
   To use a custom port, type the following. X represents the port number you would like to use (valid range between 1 and 65535).
   ``` Bash
   make run-server PORT=X
   ```

3. Start the Content Server by typing the following command in a new terminal.
   ``` Bash
   make run-content
   ```
   To use a custom port, type the following. X represents the port number you would like to use.
      ``` Bash
      make run-server PORT=X
      ```

4. Send a GET Request through a client on the default address and port, type the following command in a new terminal.
   ``` Bash
   make run-client
   ```
   To use a custom port and default address, type the following. X represents the port number you would like to use.
      ``` Bash
      make run-server PORT=X
      ```
   To use a default port and custom address, type the following. Y represents the server address in the form of "http://servername" or "servername".
         ``` Bash
         make run-server SERVER=Y
         ```
   To use a custom port and address, type the following.  Y represents the server address in the form of "http://servername" or "servername". X represents the port number you would like to use.
         ``` Bash
         make run-server SERVER=Y:X
         ```

5. Clean compiled files by typing the following command.

*Notes:*
- Due to many issues, both personal and with this specific assignment, I know that functionality is not 100% so I have this spiel here to provide and explanation.
- Also, I thought we were allowed to submit until 23:59 because that is what is on the assignment page fpr Assignment 2 (though I can now its after 5pm see on Gradescope and in the assignment description it says 5). I hope until 23:59 is okay.

Things implemented
- I believe all the codes have been put in
- The servers communicate
- PUT and GET work
- The 30s clear
- Lamport clock
- Uncertain - if the parseServerAddress function in GETClient counts as implementing the parser bonus section (though I don't think so).

Things partially implemented
- The response sent to the client from the ag server for some reason refuses to be printed in the order of the data.txt file.
I tried many different ways to get it to order correctly, to no avail. All the values match their key, but the order is incorrect.
- Various input formats with server address and/or port or default
    - I got it working for some (see the examples in the makefile instructions above) but not for the ones where domain is possible inclusion.
- Technically, when you compile make all, as I'm sure you saw / will see, It gets the Note "src/ContentServer.java uses or overrides a deprecated API." This has to do with the URL in "URL url = new URL(args[0]);" from ContentServer.java line 29.
    - I tried to find an alternate method but was clearly unable to find one that worked (each one had errors so I couldn't compile).

Thing I was unfortunately not able to implement
- StationID arg
- If the parseServerAddress function is not the parser in question, then I did not get to do the parser bonus part.
